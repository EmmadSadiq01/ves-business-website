                    Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in
                    view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to
                    that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too
                    wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.
                    Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with
                    him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his
                    vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
                    sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that
                    each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted.
